		<p class="aboutSlideText">Current social media is <b>overwhelming</b>; it has become a long laundry list of advertisements, mind-numbing statuses, and links to overlooked articles and quizzes—all of which are easily forgotten. With our lives passing us by quicker than ever, the noise leaves our days feeling <b>empty</b> and <b>mundane.</b> </p>
		<p class="aboutSlideText">We don’t intend on being the “next” of any current popular social media out there. We are offering a solution —a place for people to share the most <b>valuable</b> thing about their day, whether it be a thought, a moment, or anything. </p>
		<p class="aboutSlideText">We believe that every day is unique, special, and more importantly, <b>worth remembering.</b> We believe that your social network should make your day feel more memorable, because your day is important not only for what you did, but also for the novel experiences your friends had too. </p>
		<p class="aboutSlideText">Now imagine a news feed containing only the single most novel thing—the finer things—about an individual person’s day. Wouldn’t that be something? </p>
		<p class="aboutSlideText">Yes, it really would.</p>
		<p class="aboutSlideText">This is <b>KeepSpace</b></p>
